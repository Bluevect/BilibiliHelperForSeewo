# Bilibili Helper For Seewo
## Description
**Note: For non-seewo devices or non-touch-screen devices, installation of the extension is _unnecessary_!!**

It's not easy to set fullscreen for a [bilibili video](https://www.bilibili.com) on [Seewo devices](https://www.seewo.com) or some touch-screen devices because when clicking on the videos, no menus are popped out.
This [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) extension is here to solve the problem.

## Usage
1. Install the extension
  - Note: This extension is unable to install on *[Seewo Browser](https://e.seewo.com/#footer)*, which is the pre-installed browser on Seewo devices. **Installing _[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)_ instead of Seewo Browser is _recommended_.** The reason is that Seewo Browser used an old version of chromium, the extension icon is unable to appear. On the other hand, the keyboard is automatically appeared on Microsoft Edge but not on Seewo Browser.
2. Open a bilibili video
3. Click the extension icon to set fullscreen
